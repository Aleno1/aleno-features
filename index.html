  <p>This page shows the features available in Aleno reports. It is divided into 5 different sections:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#behavior">Behavior</a>: understand the habits of your users</li>
    <li><a href="#traffic">Traffic</a>: understand your contract usage and who is using it</li>
    <li><a href="#acquisition-retention">Acquisition & Retention</a>: Measure KPIs</li>
    <li><a href="#communities">Communities</a>: explore your user's community and what they are doing outside of your
      contract</li>
    <li><a href="#compare">Compare</a>: compare contracts together. How do stackers/holders use my other contracts? How
      do my contracts perform compare to the global market?</li>
  </ul>

  <p style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">This is a base layer with a focus on DeFi protocols. We can
    analyze logs from every kind of smart contracts, feel free to ask us for specific developments</p>
